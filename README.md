MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition System
Description: The MNIST Handwritten Digits Recognition System is a machine learning project aimed at classifying handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The system employs various algorithms and techniques to recognize and predict digits from images with high accuracy. This project showcases the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to solve a classic problem in image recognition.

Features:

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps for data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the quality and variability of the dataset.
Model Architecture: Implements different machine learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs), or other algorithms to train on the MNIST dataset.
Training and Evaluation: Involves training the model on the training set and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the test set.
Prediction Interface: Provides a user interface or script for inputting handwritten digit images and obtaining predictions from the trained model.
Visualization: Includes visualizations of training progress, model performance, and sample predictions to aid in understanding and interpreting results.
Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn (depending on your implementation)
Data Source: MNIST dataset (a large dataset of handwritten digits used for training image processing systems)
